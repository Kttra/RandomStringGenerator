# Random String Generator
Program created to generate random numbers and random strings. Using rand() and the random library.

In this program we look at the limitations of integers and how strings could be used as a work around if we are looking to print out the value to the user. There are two versions of this program. The first version uses the rand() function to generate random strings while the second version uses the random library. The usage of rand() is generally considered to have problems with it.

**Different Generation Methods**
-----------------------------------
The first method we use is calling rand itself. In this program, I have set it so rand will generate a number from 1 to the inputted value. The next method generates a random integer from 0-9 and adds them up after multiplying by 10<sup>n</sup>. The third method simply adds up numbers from 0-9 after converting them to a string. The last method uses rand to pick a random letter in the aphabet and then add it to the string.

```
Enter the highest you want your number to be (rand function): 9999
Random number generated by the rand function: 4025

Enter how long you want the number to be (addition of numbers): 9 
Random number generated by adding integers together: 418500527

Enter how long you want the next number to be (string made from integers): 9
Random number generated by string generator: 090001432

Enter how long you want your string to be (string made from letters): 9
Random string generated by string generator: BMBUvFdNk

Press enter to end the program...

**Issues with Rand**
-----------------------------------
Rand is a pseudorandom number generator since it depends on a seed. Given a seed, it'll always give the same results. This means it's not good for security reasons. This is why it is better to use the random library in modern C++.

**Replacement for Rand**
-----------------------------------
The second version of this program generates random numbers using the same methods except it does not use the rand function. Instead we generate a random number through the code below.

```
int main(){
    int digitSize = 0;  
    
    //Seed the RNG so it doesn't generate the same numbers every time 
    unsigned seed = std::chrono::system_clock::now().time_since_epoch().count();
    std::mt19937_64 rng(seed);
    
    cin >> digitSize;
    randint(rng, 0, digitSize)    
}

//Generate an integer between lbound and ubound, inclusive 
int randint(std::mt19937_64& rng, int lbound, int ubound){ 
    return rng() % (ubound - lbound + 1) + lbound; 
}
```

Looking at this code, we can see if we call ```randint(rng, 5, 20);``` the function will generate a random number ranging from 5-20 (inclusive).
